🚀 **About the Repository**
 
**Discover the ultimate GATE (Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering) Resource: All-in-One curated for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI)** 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 \
This repository is designed to collaborate and share resources for preparation, including study materials, online courses, and code examples that cover the DSAI Gate syllabus.

📚 **Syllabus Coverage**

**Syllabus:**  [Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Gate ](https://gate2026.iitg.ac.in/doc/GATE2026_Syllabus/DA_2026_Syllabus.pdf) 
(Released by GATE 2026 organizing institute)

Our repository is meticulously organized to cover the complete syllabus outlined for the DSAI section of the GATE exam. From Probability and Statistics to Math, Programming,DSA, DBMS, Machine Learning, and AI, you'll find comprehensive resources that address each topic in detail. 

**Explore the power of open source including featured tutorials, course videos, books, articles, courses, websites, code examples in Python**.\
``Theoretical explanations, practice examples, or MCQ exercises, we've got you covered in this all-encompassing guide.``\
``We aim to present a one stop resource in this Preparation-to-Interviews guide.``
